		<p>Sandra and I did not have to emotionally strain, try to check every step of our daughter and immediately punish her if she did something not the way we expected of her.  We found that now we are happy for our son, and do not compare him with others, do not judge him.  The son could imagine how he, having “read” the intentions of the opponents, gives signals to his partners.  I don’t want to talk, communicate with someone who agrees with me in everything.  As a board member of your organization, you can try to directly influence its culture, but your Circle of Influence may not yet be wide enough to actually influence the culture of FAM, so you simply submit to their demands.  - Yes!

		<p>Power: Your power to act is limited by your spouse's weaknesses and your weaknesses.  Sooner or later it will manifest itself.  Thus, the action of the price factor leads to a change in the amount of demand, which can be seen on the demand curve.  But entrepreneurs take risks, as its flip side is the possibility of earning additional income.  My own experiences with people support Frankl's idea that the highest of the three are attitudinal values.  If a specific level of productive forces forms a certain number of production relations, then there is also a reverse effect of production relations on production forces.  PERFECT COMPETITION Perfect competition is an economic situation in which: 1) no single unit acting as a buyer or seller can influence the market price of a product being bought or sold; 2) no artificial limitation prevents the factors of production from moving from one economic entity to another.
